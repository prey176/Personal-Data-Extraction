# Personal-Data-Extraction

This was the part of our Midsem Evaluation in the course Privacy and Security of Online Social Media.

The database and the analysis for the submission is not uploaded, as one of the learning from the evaluation is about how people vulnerable at social media. So, releasing such information, making another copy of data publicly available just contradicts with it.  

Only limited data is added in the database. It is only limited to academics.
